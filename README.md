<strong>Naive Bayes</strong></br>

We have a document D containing d words; call the words {X1, ..., Xd}. The value of random variable Xi is the word found in position i in the document. We wish to predict the label Y of the document. In this dataset, each document is a posting that was made to one of 20 different usenet newsgroups. In this project, we implemented the Naive Bayes document classifier and applied it to the classic 20 newsgroups dataset.</br>
</br>
This project(training and testing) is hard coded without using machine learning libraries.</br> And matplotlib is used for plotting.
