Problem Description:</br>

Say we have a document D containing d words; call the words {X1, ..., Xd}. The value of random variable Xi is the word found in position i in the document. We wish to predict the label Y of the document. In this project, you will implement the Naive Bayes document classifier and apply it to the classic 20 newsgroups dataset. In this dataset, each document is a posting that was made to one of 20 different usenet newsgroups.</br>
